        <h1>Libbie Alexander: ALLive Reboot</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For my independent project, I am planning to revive and enhance my high-fidelity prototype from my SMAD 317 class. In the class, my partner and I ideated, designed, and prototyped a virtual live music streaming app called ALLive. Throughout the process, we were able to learn first-hand the fundamentals of interaction design and how to design interactive systems through brainstorming, user research, sketching, sitemapping, paper prototyping, and prototyping using Adobe XD. Although I was very happy with how the app turned out, I feel that my lack of expertise in using Adobe XD was a major setback. Moreover, I feel that our user research process could have been improved to give us more meticulous and accurate findings.</p>
        <h2>Goals:</h2>
            <p>Here is a more specific list of goals for the app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Redo user research and testing to improve the process by considering user feedback more meticulously.</li>
                <li>Rework visual design of the app to make it more aesthetically pleasing using design principles from <i>Technically Wrong</i>.</li>
                <li>Make my high-fidelity prototype more functional and user-friendly using principles from <i>Technically Wrong</i>.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Audience:</h2>
            <p>My target audience for the app is young to middle-aged adults who are avid music listeners and live music lovers. They are looking to gain the experience of going to concerts and live music events from the comfort of their homes while simultaneously having the ability to connect with performers and fellow fans as they would at a real-life live concert or music festival. They are also tech-savvy and in need of a user-friendly app that they can easily navigate to find their favorite artists and genres of music. </p>
        <h2>Timeline:</h2>
            <p>Here is a tentative timeline for my project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>September 12-18:</b> Adobe XD LinkedIn Learning</li>
                <li><b>September 19-25:</b> User research, personas, scenarios, and storyboards</li>
                <li><b>September 26-October 2:</b> Concept ideation, sketching, and sitemapping</li>
                <li><b>October 3-9:</b> Paper prototyping and testing</li>
                <li><b>October 10-16:</b> Low-fidelity prototyping and testing</li>
                <li><b>October 17-23:</b> High-fidelity prototyping and testing</li>
                <li><b>October 24-29:</b> Final touches</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Visual Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Here are some visual samples that I found from Pinterest to help me guide the ux and visual design of my app:</p>
